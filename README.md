MyXRPL DeFi is a way to maximize your XRPL token holdings.
Take advantage of the Reverse Swap calculator and boost your piles of each asset.
Swap some of your assets for other assets (through AMM pools).
Then load your r-address into the Turbocharger (direct ipfs link below).
When you log in and Flip The Switch, it loads your transaction history of all your past swaps.
It groups all past swaps within Swap Pairs in chronological order.
It starts with your oldest trade (keeping running total) and goes through your swaps in the same order you filled them.
It then reports your profits or loss (means you have assets sitting waiting to be swapped back).
Once you've made enough profitable swaps, all your Token Positions will eventually go green.
Meaning, those tokens are pure profit (this takes time and you making swaps whenever over 15-20% profit).
It reports your Realized Profit on each asset pair, from your first swap until latest swap.
It looks at live prices to tell you if it's profitable to reverse swap your Latest Position (updates prices every minute).
If you have enough pairs of assets, the Sequential Swap Chains will start to show chains.
You can set the threshold to filter out smaller swap profit values.
The chain will display your estimated return if you follow the swaps.
The Chart section shows Tokens per XRP (Inverse of Price)
It also shows live data (minus very small transactions) of High/Low and Volume
To see a different asset, select the asset you'd like to see in Token Positions
