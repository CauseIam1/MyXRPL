Token Swapping Turbocharger is a way to maximize your token holdings.
Take advantage of the Reverse Swap calculator and boost your piles of each asset.
Swap some of your assets for other assets (through AMM pools).
Then load your r-address into the Turbocharger (direct ipfs link below).
When you log in the site and hit the Ignition button, it loads your transaction history of all your past swaps.
It groups all past swaps within Swap Pairs in chronological order.
It starts with your oldest trade (keeping running total) and goes through your swaps in the same order you filled them.
It then reports your profits or loss (means you have assets sitting waiting to be swapped back).
Once you've made enough profitable swaps, all your Token Positions will eventually go green.
Meaning, those tokens are pure profit (this takes time and you making swaps whenever over 15-20% profit).
It reports your Realized Profit on each asset pair, from your first swap until latest swap.
It looks at live prices to tell you if it's profitable to reverse swap your Latest Position.
If you have enough pairs of assets and conditions met, the Sequential Swap Chains will start to show.
You can set the threshold to filter out smaller swap profit values.
The chain will display your estimated return if you follow the swap chain swaps.
The page auto updates all calculations every minute.
