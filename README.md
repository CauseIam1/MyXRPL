# MyXRPL
AMM Turbocharger
This site is being developed as a way to maximize AMM and asset holdings. On top of the amazing AMM itself.
Here's how it works...
Let's start with 5 XRPL assets (non corelating) and let's create an AMM pool for each asset pair.
Set the fee for the pools to 1% (the max) as you own the pool and since you'll be swapping through your pool, 
you want your pool to make 1% of the value being swqpped through it. 
This increases your pool size slowly over time, as well as what the AMM has managed to accumulate during volitily.
So, if we have 5 assets and pools for each pair, we'll have 10 AMM pools
1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/5, 2/3, 2/4, 2/5, 3/4, 3/5, 4/5
Make small swaps through each pool to ensure they're working and to give the site a starting point to do calculations from.
When you log in the site, it loads your transaction history of swaps.
It groups all past swaps within swap pairs.
It then works out your past trades in chronological order and reports your profit/loss on each asset pair, from your first swap until current.
It then looks at the exchange rate of your latest past swap of non xrp assets and compares it to the current exchange rate for the pair.
After it's calculated all of the above, it puts the most profitable reverse swap at the top of the list where it shows how much you could receive
if you made a reverse swap of your latest swap. 
It also displays the breakdown and analysys of your previous swaps for this pair so you can see how you're doing overall trading with this pair.
On the right side of the screen, there's an AMM to obtain live quotes and verify the reverse swap suggestion.
The AMM can only focus on 1 trade pair at a time. Select the trade pair you'd like to see the AMM pool for by selecting the trading pair in your list.
The AMM will then move from the trade it was focused on and move to the trade you selected. 
You can then enter your latest swap value into the AMM and fetch a live quote to verify what would happen if you did the reverse swap 



Stage 2 will be the addition of shots of Nitrious.
I have a concept I'm working on that involves multiple squential swaps. But I'll leave it there for now...
