Can you help me add a bit of functionality to index.html? Keep current functionality working.
Can we incorporate a professional looking XRPL theme in this XRPL based website

Here's how the AMM Turbocharger help's you Turbocharge your AMM pools. 
Using the Xaman App (put link to playstore here) & using your favorite Xapp.
Pick 2 noncorrelating XRPL tokens & create an AMM pool. Set the fees for the pool at 1%
Make sure to include equal portions of each token. (eg. 5 xrp worth of each)
Keep a small pile of each asset in your wallet as you'll be doing some swaps through your AMM. 
This will increase your pool's size, amount of each token along with the amazing abilities of the AMM.
Make very small trades until you understand how it all works. 
Stage 2 is in concept. Going to add Nitrous.

The current page (once logged in) shows the .nav bar at the top.
I'd like this bar to always stay there and can you add a 'disconnect' button to properly disconnect me from the ledger?
Below the .nav bar, the page currently displays my transaction history of payments.
Now that I have a functional display of payments, I'd like to narrow the search.
I only want to display payments if they are 'Swapped Token' and exclude xrp as either of the 'Swapped Tokens'
This should result in only showing 'Swapped Tokens' of trustline assets and not xrp itself.
Create a list 'previous swaps' using the 'Swapped Tokens' in our search (search back 100 or more transactions if possible)
We need to get some info from the raw data of each 'Swapped Token' transaction
This list will include the following
For asset 1 (get from raw data under 'SendMax')
'currency' ( call 'c1' )
'issuer' ( call 'i1' )
'value' ( call 'v1' )
For asset 2 (get from Tx Metadata under 'DeliveredAmount')
'currency' ( call 'c2' )
'issuer' ( call 'i2' )
'value' ( call 'v2' )
If there are no 'Swapped Token' after our search criteria display a message
(You have no Swapped Token in your history. Please make a small Swap to get started.)
Let's start with the first 'Swapped Tokens' in our list 'previous swaps'
Let's break down the swap. 
We swapped 'v1' of 'c1' and received 'v2' of 'c2'
Add AMM functionality using references below (Resources:)
Get an AMM quote to swap 'v2' amount of 'c2' into 'v1' ( call 'q1' )
Get an andditional AMM quote to swap 'v1' of 'c1' into 'v2' ( call 'q2' )
I'd like to know if I swapped 'asa2' of 'as2' back into 'as1' how many 'as1' will I receive ( 'r1' )?
I'd also like to know, if I swapped 'asa1' of 'as1' how many 'as2' would I receive ( 'r2' )?
When displaying the currency-code of our 'Swapped Token' some of the currency-codes are too long.
If you see the following currency-code, show their nickname (as shown below)
'245452554D500000000000000000000000000000' show '$Trump'
'4D454C414E494100000000000000000000000000' show 'Melania'
'424152524F4E5452554D50000000000000000000' show 'BARRONTRUMP'
If any currency-code are still more than 12 characters in length, truncate their display in 'Swapped Token'
When displaying token amounts in 'Swapped Token' display to 2 decimal places
Display each 'Swapped Token' in it's own section
Display name 'as1' and name 'as2' 
Display % increase/decrease by comparing how many we started with 'asa1' and how many we would have after swapping ( reply from AMM)
Display % increase/decrease by comparing how many 'as2' tokens we would receive if me made the same trade (second reply from AMM)
If ( 'r1' > 'asa1' * 2 ) have the outer edges of this section pulse electric blue around the border
If ( 't' < 'asa1' * 0.5 ) have the outer edges of this section pulse electric purple around the border
Please display the info that explains our calculations in an easy to understand way and give recommendation based on potential profit keeping in mind, because there is a 1% fee on the AMM pool and this fee is incurred in both directions, anything under 25% is probably not worth swapping.
Make a section for each 'Swapped Token' in list 'previous swaps'. There should be about 6-8 of them
Add ability to remove trades 'previous swaps' (view shortened list while still connected to this session)
Add a 'Refresh' button to the .nav bar.
If the 'Refresh' button gets pressed, refresh 'asset-list', recalculate all the 'Swapped Token' and display the new results.
